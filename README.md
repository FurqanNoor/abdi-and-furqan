# abdi-and-frugo

Here is some info about the project 
So 1 person makes the main website and the github project and other person makes the 2 website that will be linked into the first one.
The website we made was based on an anime series called demon slayer.
We added background, text, photos and video to the page and made it look nicer.
The websites turned out to be quite nice looking and we learned alot while making them.
We did have alot of problems but together we got through them and now our pages look clean.
